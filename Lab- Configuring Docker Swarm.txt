Configuring Docker Swarm:

Step1:
	Install 3 VMs
	1. Manager
	2. worker
	3. Worker
Step2:
	Install docker on three nodes with sudo su -
	$sudo su -
	$sudo apt-get install docker.io
Check the status of docker
	$service docker status
Ports to be opened: 2377, 7946, 4789
Check the private ip of a vm to initialize it to docker swarm.
	$ifconfig
if ifconfig is not aovailable, install it with $apt install net-tools
Step3:
	Initialize Vm1 to Swarm Manager
	$sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <privateip>
	It will provide command to join worker nodes. Use the command to 	join the owrker nodes.
Step4: Check the node status with command
	$sudo docker node ls
	$docker info [will provide complete information about swarm architechture]
Step5: To leave any worker from swarm
	$sudo docker swarm leave [run from the worker]
Step6: Once the Worker node left, we can delete the node
	$sudo docker node rm <nodeid>
Step7: If we want to remove manager node itself from swarm
	$sudo docker swarm leave --force
If you forgot to save the doecke swarm token to join nodes, use the command
	$docker swarm join-token worker
	$docker swarm join-token manager [to add another manager]

To get the complete information about the docker env on your machine 
	$docker info

Deploying services and managing docker swarm

	$docker service create --name mywebserver --replicas 3 --publish 80:80 httpd
Relicas are created to high availability of the service

To check the service
	$docker service inspect --pretty <servicename>

Check with each node address on browser so ensure that httpd is availalbe on all nodes
To check the service
	$docker service ls [list the services and its replica count]
	$docker service ps <serviceid> [each service is running deferent node]
[check with docker ps command on each node so find that each container runs in deferent node]	

Try to remove a service container and check that it will be up by swarm
	$docker rm -f <containername>
After some time container is up and running
Delete a container service and check httpd in browser. Container buillds up with in no time.

To remove the service from docker swarm
	$docker service rm <servicename>

Docker Stack

Create deploy.yml

version: '3'
services:
  webserver:
    image: "httpd:latest"
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
  appserver:
    image: "tomcat:latest"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"


To deploy the stack
	$docker stack deploy -c demo.yml mystack

once deployed check with 
	$docker service ls
If you want to increase the replicas
	$docker service scale <serviceid>=6
To check
	$docker service ps <serviceid>
To check on each node for services
	$docker ps
